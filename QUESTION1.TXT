AFTER MANY STATES HTTP1.1 FOUND AND 2015 HTTP2 WAS FOUND.

THE MAIN DIFFERENT BETWEEN AFTER
2.HTTP 1.1  WORKS IN TEXTUAL FORMAT AND HTTP2 WORKS ON THE BINARY PROTOCOL METHOD

3. LOADING FACTOR :IN HTTP1.1 RESOURCE LOADED ONE BY ONE,IF ONE METHOD
LOADS BLOCKED ,ALL OTHER METHOD ALSO BLOCKED ,IN HTTP2 -MULTIPLE STREAMS LOADED AT THE TIME ,
IF ONE BLOCKED,THIS  WON'T AFFECT THE OTHER STREAMS

4.SERVER RESPONSE:HTTP1 GIVES THE DETAIL WHAT CLIENT ASK BUT 
HTTP2 SERVE THE DEATAIL BEFORE CLIENT ASK AND SERVE THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

5.COMPRESSION METHOD:
SMALLER FILES LOAD FASTLY THEN LARGE,SO HTTP1.1 COMPERESS LARGE FILE INTO SMALL IT GIVES QUICKER 
RESPONSE.IN HTTP2 HAVING A HPACK COMPRESSION METHOD ITS ELIMINATE THE UNWATE THE BYTES 
FROM THE HTTP PACKET IT GIVES FASTER LOADING.
